# Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), also known as heart and blood vessel diseases have become the number one cause of death in the world. This disease has claimed about 17.9 million lives in a year, which means it accounts for 31% of deaths worldwide. 4 out of 5 CVDs are caused by heart disease and stroke, and people under the age of 70 account for a third of deaths from heart disease and stroke.

# Datasets
The dataset we use is a set of heart failure data. The dataset consists of attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, old peak, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and the output class (whether the subject has heart disease or not) of 918 distinct observations.

### Attribute Information

- Age: age of the patient [years]
- Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
- Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
- FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
- MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
- ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
- ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
- HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
